# üß† Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how various machine learning models and neural networks can be used to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data. The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, which contains diagnostic measurements for female patients.

## ‚úÖ Models Used

### 1. Logistic Regression
- Simple baseline for binary classification.
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
- Tree-based model with `max_depth` tuning.
- Includes a full decision tree visualization.

### 3. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Classifier using Euclidean distance.
- `n_neighbors = 5`.

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Linear kernel used for classification.
- Confusion matrix and classification report included.

### 5. Feedforward Neural Network (Keras)
- Input layer: 12 neurons
- Hidden layer: 8 neurons
- Output layer: 1 neuron (sigmoid)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Binary Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Visualized training history (loss & accuracy over epochs)

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**
- **ROC Curves (optional in extended analysis)**

Visualizations are created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
